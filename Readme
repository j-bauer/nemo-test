To easybuild to users work:
	Easybuild must be installed in a acessible area And the module file must know where.
	My module will set the prefix for $HOME/easybuild
	
The module file will:
	use the easybuild module file path
	use the user easybuild module file path ( or this should be done in the profile.d?? If the path exist uses it, sounds good, and but the module can use it again, dont think that this is a problem)
	set the EASYBUILD_PREFIX
	set the EASYBUILD_ROBOT_PATH
	load eb

The deploy fase:
	Should copy the full project (when master) to something like /opt/nemo-ci/
	The jenkinsscript should be runned from /opt/nemo-ci and also the production.sh

This also allows us to have users submitting pull requests
